1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy? 

2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:
The above video is a great way to understand different methods of calculating
probabilities in a way such that students and other individuals who prefer coding
can understand. It talks about how testing a fair probability / equal chance
for anything can be calculated with binomial distribution. Another method that
can be easily coded is shuffling to create a random order, and calculate the
probability for a hypothesis. Moreover, bootstrapping is another method that can
estimate the distribution of a sample statistic, also done by coding if chosen to.
The main point of the video was to introduce methods that are easy for 'Hackers'
to calculate probabilities and test hypothesis when needed

4) H0 is
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference between the probability of P1
winning and the probability of P2 winning. H0: P(P1) = P(P2)

5) Ha is
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant difference in the winning probabilities
of player 1 and player 2. Specifically, P2 has a higher probability of winning compared to
P1. Ha: P(P2) > P(P1).


6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results support H0, so they do not support Ha

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0

We will use normal approximation to binomial distribution to determine whether the difference
in number of wins is significant enough to reject H0, or not.

The number of P1 wins in the experiment is 4585. The number of P2 wins is 4910. Ties are negligible
for the calculations since it does not affect the hypothesis
We want to calculate the probability that the game results in P2 winning more than or equal to 4910.
This is because our Ha is P2 > P1. Thus, we need to see the probability of what we observe from our expriement.

(checking whether the experiment results are close to expected results of equal winnings).
Thus, n (number of non tie games) = 9495
      X (number of wins P2) = 4910
      p (expected probability of P2 wins) = 0.5
Then, μ = n*p = 4747.5 and n*(1-p) = 4747.5
      σ = √(n*p*(1-p)) = √(9495*0.5*0.5) = 48.72
      now, z = (x – μ) / σ = (4910 - 4747.5) / 48.72 = 3.335.
      Thus, since the z value is 3.335 > 0.5, this implies that the dif
